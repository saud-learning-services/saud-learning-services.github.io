title: Canvas Peer Reviews

summary: Canvas Peer Reviews is a Jupyter Notebook and Python script that works with Canvas LMS Data to create formatted .csv tables containing peer review data. Upon providing the necessary inputs, the notebook will produce two .csv files in the "peer_review_data" folder (in the project's root directory). The data tables will provide an overview of all assigned peer reviews for a given assignment - including all students who've been assigned as assessors, who they are assessing and the results of any completed assessments.
