title: Canvas Subaccount Movement

summary: Canvas Subaccount Movement is a Jupyter Notebook and Python script that moves any Sauder course into a specific Canvas sub-account. Upon providing the necessary input, the script will locate the appropriate sub-account, migrate the course to it, and produce a CSV file detailing the courses and the sub-accounts.

### TODO: Learning Services Instructions for Use

- should include information related to everything except actually running the project
- how should ops know when to run
- how regularly is the tool used
- what should ops do with the data (if any) once downloaded
- any manual steps that need to take place after running?
- any common issues to be aware of
- if no output created how is ops tracking when it is run and by who?
